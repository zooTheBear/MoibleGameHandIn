## Gameplay:
**Zombies**
- Zombies spawn on the right side of the screen and move towards the left.
- If the zombie is close to the turret or a wall it will attack it to break the turret or wall.
- Zombies have different health and speed and some will move very fast but are a lot easier to kill then the slow moving one.

## Additional Features
- High Scores are saved and shown at the end of the game.
- How many enemy zombies were killed is also displayed on the game over screen.
- Networking component is Google Ad Mod displayed at the bottom of the screen in the view controller.

## Challenges
- The biggest challenge was the performance, there is lag when I turn the particle effects on.
- Testing is was a problem since I didn't have a iphone I had to use the mouse instead of taping, I don't know how the controles will feel when the player can tap instead of having to use a mouse.
